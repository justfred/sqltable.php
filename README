sqltable.php

sqltable is an extensible class for creating and consuming sql table
data with minimal programming.  It's intended to be called from php.  In many cases this should allow access to mysql without having to create sql queries.

sqltable_ajax is a wrapper for calling it from AJAX, returning JSON.
